# Cryptocurrencies
“Hodling”, a word created for the cryptocurrency market, was originally a typo. It soon came to stand for “hold on for dear life” as the markets peaks and troughs sent many investors to either millionaire status or back to living with their parents. Even with the volatility, investors have become intrigued with the possibility of a quick success and the mysterious nature of the system can allude the most cunning minds. 

Our client, Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, would like to offer cryptocurrency options to their customers. As previously noted, the market can create confusion and concern for even prominent banks with significant resources. Our firm provided services to create reports to comprehend the cryptocurrency market, understand the function and classifications, and ultimately provide recommendations to their clients. 

The data selected was processed to a usable format. After preprocessing and reducing the data using PCA, our firm grouped cryptocurrencies with clustering algorithms. These methods allowed the creation of visuals to displays the results and enable multiple parties to understand the results.
